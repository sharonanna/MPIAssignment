# Understanding human metacognitive learning
Mouselab-MDP is a [JsPsych](https://github.com/jodeleeuw/jsPsych/) plugin that renders Markov decision processes (MDP) for participants to navigate through. Optionally, information about the environment can be presented only when the participant asks for it by clicks.

This adaptation can be used to test whether misalignment increases planning time ie: when the generated rewards are random, the user should take more time to plan a path through the grid with maximal reward.

The python file in experiment/bin/make_trials.py generates the trials.json file that is used in experiment.js which in turn is generated by a coffee script - experiment.coffee

There are 2 experiments: \
Experiment 1 (Spider as player): user can click on nodes (deduction of 1 point) but the reward generated is random.\
Experiment 2 (Plane as player): user can click on edges to view the rewards and then plan a path.
